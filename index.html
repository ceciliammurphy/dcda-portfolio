            <p>Welcome to my Skills Portfolio for DCDA 40833. This site showcases the work I've completed throughout the semester, demonstrating my growth in digital culture and data analytics.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> Hi y'all! I'm Cecilia Murphy, but you can call me Cece. I am a senior Journalism major with a minor in DCDA! I can't believe I am graduating this May, but I am so excited to move to the city of my dreams. Please explore my portfolio and view all of my awesome work from this semester!</p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> My first love has always been dance, but I have always had a passion for the arts - fashion, museums, the stage, and film and television. I was drawn to DCDA because of how many creative classes were offered for this foucs. I wanted to expand on what I already knew (like art and photography), as well as grow in my knowledge in areas I was not as familiar with, such as film and code.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> In this course, I hope to deepen my knowledge and skills within VS Code (HTML, CSS, and JS) but also learn new programs, such as Python, ArcGIS, and Tableau. I learned a little python a couple years ago, but I am excited for a refresher on the language and learning more about it as well!</p>
